## App Overview

### Description

This is an app that allows users to observe the current weather status of various cities around the world. Users can select from this
list to more closely observe a particular city with more details on its weather. 

### App Evaluation

<!-- Evaluation of your app across the following attributes -->

- **Category:** Weather/Tools and Utilities

- **Story:** This app gives a simple view of key weather statistics of various cities allowing users to quickly observe them, uncluttered from other unnecessary details.
- **Market:** Most of people need to check weather before having any plan. We provide a nice option
- **Habit:** User may open and check weather everyday before they go outside.
