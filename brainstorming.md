### Weather App
- **Mobile:** Accessibility. Allows user to check weather quickly instead of opening a browser

    -  design UI/UX

- **Story:** Can be used by animal lovers to quickly gain
  information about their interest animal.
- **Market:** People who are animal lovers or animal enthusiasts. Maybe zoos can utilize this app for people who want to learn more about specific animals.
- **Habit:** For an average animal lover, the frequency of app usage will be almost everyday.
- **Scope:** Rather limited in scope as the information is limited to animals. UI will also be rather simple.


### Recipe/Cookbook App
- **Mobile:** A small, portable device is ideal in a kitchen environment, allowing users to rapidly look at the recipe.
- **Story:** People always struggle with deciding what to cook, so a recipe app would ease the burden of looking for quality recipes online. Instead, there would be a lot of good recipes all on the same app.
- **Market:** Any at home cook can use this app.
- **Habit:** Users can use this app everyday because people cook almost everyday. They can also create their own recipes and share it with others.
- **Scope:** V1 will be using a recipe API and displaying recipes. We could implementing specific recipe lookups. V2 could be users sharing their own recipes. V3 perhaps a login system and recipe leaderboard.
